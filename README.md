the majority of the photos i use to manually (and painstakingly) color-correct this LUT was taken on my iphone XR, so it should work best for most iphone images, but it should work equally as well with android images too (although for both iphone and android images, you'll need to unsharpen the photos for the best visual quality)

on iOS, the camera app i use to put on these LUTs is this obscure app called fotorgear (works surprisingly well), and if i wanna apply the LUTs to pre-existing photos, i use the app "PeekLUT"
